Revision history for local::lib

1.003002 2009-02-25
        - Add a doc patch from Torsten Raudssus <torsten@raudssus.de> that
          clarifies how to specify a directory other than ~/perl5.

1.003001 2009-01-14
        - Properly bail if given fancy dashes obtained by copy-pasting from a
          UTF8-happy POD formatter. This will bail in both the Makefile.PL and
          in local::lib::import().

1.003000 2009-01-13
        - Add the --self-contained flag from Mark Stosberg, which also contains
          a doc patch warning about the dangers of UNINST=1. Thanks, Mark!
